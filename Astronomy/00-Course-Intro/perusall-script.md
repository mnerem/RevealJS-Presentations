Our class will use Perusall for reading assignments 
by having students read book chapters and actively engage 
with the material.
You will need to make at least two comments on the chapters, 
and reply to at least one other student's comment to 
foster discussion and deeper understanding of the material.

Hopefully this leads to meaningful insights into astronomy
and helps you find ways to express your
thoughts or questions. 

With every student writing on the book the Perusall page
can feel overwhelming at times.
So I recommend that you use the menu in 
the top right corner of Perusall
to adjust the comments/discussions that you can see.
